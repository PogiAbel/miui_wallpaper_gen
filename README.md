Choose images, then corp to corp each to 1080*2040 then it automatically concats them and you can download it.
Then in wallpaper settings choose the homescreen and where you can see the preview in the right upper corner you can select the shifting option.

Concat as many images as many pages you have on the phone, if you want to two page have the same image then add the image twice.
